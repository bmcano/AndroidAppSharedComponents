# Shared Components for my Android Apps

This is a shared library that I created for my set of electronic calculator Android apps that use many of the same components and utiltiies. 
This library will help me maintain all of these shared items to be consistent with for each app that uses this module. 

This module is not intended for public use, since most things are specific to me and my apps, but the repository is being made public so I can easily import the dependency into my Androids applications.
